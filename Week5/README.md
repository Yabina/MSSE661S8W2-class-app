# Module 5 - Advanced JavaScript Concepts


Have our website talk to the back-end service and display data.

Errors I find with this project

- app.js 
--.style.display = 'none'. Error say's cannot be none
--  e.preventDefault(); makes it skip actual login
-- register is not used anywhere

- auth.service.js
-- USER_API - has not been declared anywhere
-- _post -has not been declared
-- register is not used anywhere

- Tasklist couldn't be built

Encountered a lot of errors so I decided to build my own.
